			<p>The famous Koh-i-Noor ("mountain of light” in Persian) diamond
				weights 105.60 cts and is considered one of the 5 priciest diamonds
				in the world was mined in Golconda, India, and owned by India. Later
				on it was taken by many invaders ending up on the crown of queen
				Elizabeth of Great Britain. India has claimed the diamond and has
				said that the Koh-i-Noor was taken away illegally and that it should
				be given back to India. When Queen Elizabeth II made a state visit
				to India marking the 50th anniversary of independence in 1997, many
				Indians in India and Britain demanded the return of the diamond. On
				21 February 2013, while visiting India, David Cameron, the UK Prime
				Minister, said that it would be illogical to return the diamond.</p>
